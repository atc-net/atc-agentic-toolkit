# Azure Cosmos DB Monitoring & Diagnostics

Best practices for monitoring Azure Cosmos DB performance and diagnosing issues.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Setting up monitoring for Cosmos DB accounts
- Tracking RU consumption and latency
- Configuring alerts for throttling
- Enabling diagnostic logging
- Integrating with Azure Monitor

## Rules

- [monitoring-ru-consumption](references/monitoring-ru-consumption.md) - Track RU consumption
- [monitoring-latency](references/monitoring-latency.md) - Monitor P99 latency
- [monitoring-throttling](references/monitoring-throttling.md) - Alert on throttling
- [monitoring-azure-monitor](references/monitoring-azure-monitor.md) - Integrate Azure Monitor
- [monitoring-diagnostic-logs](references/monitoring-diagnostic-logs.md) - Enable diagnostic logging
