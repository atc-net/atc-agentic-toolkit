# Azure Cosmos DB Security

Security best practices for Azure Cosmos DB accounts, covering authentication, network isolation, access control, and data protection.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Setting up authentication for Cosmos DB
- Configuring network access restrictions
- Assigning RBAC roles for data plane access
- Enabling continuous backup
- Hardening a Cosmos DB account for production

## Rules

- [security-disable-local-auth](references/security-disable-local-auth.md) - Disable local authentication (keys)
- [security-managed-identity](references/security-managed-identity.md) - Use managed identity with DefaultAzureCredential
- [security-network-restrict](references/security-network-restrict.md) - Restrict network access
- [security-rbac-least-privilege](references/security-rbac-least-privilege.md) - Assign minimum RBAC roles
- [security-continuous-backup](references/security-continuous-backup.md) - Enable continuous backup for PITR
